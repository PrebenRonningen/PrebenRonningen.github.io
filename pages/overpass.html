							<h1>Overpass 2</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="../images/banner/OverpassBanner.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I have been working with the Overpass 2 team sinse October 2022.
							<br>During my time on the projec I have played a key role in getting the games from alpha to its final shippable state.</p>
							<b>My main role was to communicate with the design department and translate their designs into fully integrated features.</b>
							<p>My code and work spans throughout the games entire code base, I don't think there's any aspect of the games code that I did not touch in my time on this project.
								I have been tasked with finding, understanding and refactoring legacy code, as well as taking over and finishing work that was left in a half finished state.
								The systems and features I chose to highlight in the rest of this page are the larger and more tangible contributions from me.   
							</p>
							<div>
								<b>Player Skill tree. Player progression system, Levels, experience, money.</b>
								<div style="flex: 1; padding: 1px; text-align: left;">
									<img src="../images/Overpass 2/SkillView.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
									<p>Skill tree menu: Scrollable categories(top left). Hovered skill, info, cost, available points, reset panel(right top to bottom). Skill tree pannel showing all skills(center). Spent/total points(left).<br>
										This menu is usable with both mouse and keyboard, or a gamepad controller. Selecting skills, zooming and paning around in the center menu is posible wiht both control types.<br>
										Player progress: The players level, level progress, and currently held credits can be seen at the top of the menu.<br>
										I implemented the system in place for rewarding and keeping track of the player's level, acquired skillpoints, and currency.</p>
								</div>
							</div>

							<div>
								<b>Race Reward system and menu.</b>
								<div style="flex: 1; padding: 1px; text-align: left;">

										Race rewards pannel on the right, shows current level and progression bar. Total accumulated XP from the race. Credit rewards from sponsor. Credit reward from Race. Total accumulated Credits. New unlocked vehicle accesories. (from top to bottom respectively)</p>
								</div>

								<b>Race Simulation, Simulation menu.</b>
								<div style="flex: 1; padding: 1px; text-align: left;">
									<img src="../images/Overpass 2/SimView.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

									<p>Implemented sponsor menu, and following objectives connected to sponsors displayed in a race. As well as the mechanics of objectives.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							
							<b>Race Track Data:</b>
							 <p>Implemented a collection to keep track of all neccassary data for the track to be used throughout the game, such as tack section length, track looping, track start/end, surface, obtacle locations, track section ai-information.</p>
							
							 <div>
								<p>Race start position rules: <br>
